# updatedDatabaseCode
THANK YOU LORD FOR THIS NEW CODE

So to explain this in layman's terms we need to create a database first.
use php/admin

The first thing to do is to define the items that go into your database. As an example below,

$firstName = $_POST['firstName'];
$lastName = $_POST['lastName'];
$gender = $_POST['gender'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
$password = $_POST['password'];
$number = $_POST['number'];
